I previously worked at [Axiom Data Science](https://axiomdatascience.com) as a Computational Science.

I've also written a dissertation on sediment dynamics, estuarine physics, and the aquatic light environment of the Columbia River estuary, taught intro to computer science for engineering undergrads, taught high school and middle school math as a member of AmeriCorps, fixed arcade video games, tested multimode lasers, and studied history.
